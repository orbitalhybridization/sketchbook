      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I've always been interested in human interaction and communication. As a teen, I liked trying to express my inner
        thoughts via non-linguistic expressions that I called "inclinations." The idea was that these intuitions were more
        efficient than words, and that they could be used to communicate complex ideas in a more direct way.

      <h2>Scientific Foundations</h2>
      <p>
        The basic scientific premise that got me into this is the idea of modeling human interaction as a dynamical system.
        This started while I was taking classes on dynamical systems and human interaction, and I started to wonder how we
        could use dynamical systems tools to model human interaction.

      <h2>Influential Research</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>1. Pedersen & Stevensen (2014)</h3>
        <p>
          In their paper, they propose a model for human interaction that spans several spatiotemporal scales, from the microscale
          of biological processes to the macroscale of phylogeny. This philosophical approach to human interaction was fascinating to me.

      <article>
        <h3>2. Dale & Kello (2017)</h3>
        <p>
          This paper offers three conditions for "sensemaking" in humans: dynamic memory, multimodal integration, and timescale integration,
          all properties also shared by reservoir computing models.

      <article>
        <h3>3. Dr. Uri Hasson's Research</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Hasson's work demonstrates how the brain processes information during communication and naturalistic stimuli. His findings highlight
          the importance of temporal receptive windows for creating coherent understanding, especially at the event level.

      <h2>Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My goal with this line of research is to improve communication. As I thought from a young age, communication is more than just words, and
        I believe that by understanding the dynamical systems that underlie human interaction, we can improve communication and understanding
        between people. This is a lofty goal, but one that I believe is worth pursuing.
