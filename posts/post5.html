      <h2>Better When It's Spoken (Demo)</h2>
      <p><em>Published Jan 30, 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        This demo is #18 from my nightly creative practices. When working on vocals and lyrics for these songs, 
        I found it most helpful to find a person or general sound to emulate. For this song, it was a dark pop-inspired 
        Billie Eilish sound. I love the sound of her whispering, floaty vocals with a bit of a foreboding tune in songs 
        like <i>goodbye</i> on When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?.
      </p>

      <p>
        The instrumental outro was actually a fun accident. Because I use the Jam Looper app for my demo recordings, 
        the drums suddenly restarted while I was at the end of recording the keyboard. I just reacted by playing some 
        block chords that sounded nice, and it worked out. So I added another track, threw in a keys solo and voila!
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of the lyrics are poetic lines that I thought sounded nice while I was listening to the keys I'd played as 
        a foundation. The hook, "it's better when it's spoken," is a reference to my goal of learning to be more vocal 
        and assertive about things that are important to me (I tend to be soft-spoken when it comes to some things). 
        Somehow, that worked its way into this song.

        Lastly, "i make it up" refers to, well, making up the words of the song as I went along.

        More recently, my friend Matt and I fully produced this demo into a song, which I plan to post soon!

      <h3><u>Lyrics</u></h3>

      <p>
      it's not too late to take a picture of it all<br>
      a stolen glance of what is here and what is left<br>
      because the sickness is so captivating still<br>
      because in stillness it lasts longer than a thrill<br>
      <br>
      i wrote this song<br>
      to cure me of a poison<br>
      with no clear path<br>
      it's better when it's spoken<br>
      <br>
      i make it up<br>
      </p>
