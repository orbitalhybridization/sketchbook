      <h2>Oh, happiness! (Song 89)</h2>
      <p><em>Published Jan 18, 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        This folksy tune came to me during one of the nightly creative practice sessions I've
        been having over the last few months. The sound is primarily inspired by Adrianne Lenker,
        Haley Heynderickx, and a bit of Angel Olsen. I really like the lilting harmonies and the
        dissonant B6 contrasted against the E Major.

        As I was putting the song together, it started to feel like one of those folk songs that
        tells a story. The song <i>Lighthouse</i> by Adrianne Lenker from Hours Were the Birds
        especially came to mind (where she also sings about the woes of being seventeen). The story is a
        fun little fabrication, and he working title of the song (Oh, happiness!) is a bit of a play on 
        the Molly Drake song, <i>Happiness</i>, from The Tide's Magnificence: Songs and Poems of Molly Drake.
