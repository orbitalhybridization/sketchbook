      <h2>A Hum (Song 84)</h2>
      <p><em>Published Dec 25, 2024</em></p>

      <p>
        This is a short track of a nice little acoustic plucking pattern that came to me after a jam session with some friends.
        Instead of lyrics, I thought humming would be a nice touch, in the style of Ichiko Aoba. The altogether sound,
        including the shower running in the background, is inspired by "Wet," the first track in Jockstrap's 2018 EP,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CezIFlomK-o" target="_blank">Love is the Key to the City</a>.
      </p>

        The song is also part of a series of demos that I've been working on as a creative practice. It is the 84th song in the series.
