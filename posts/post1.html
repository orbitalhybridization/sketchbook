      <p>This is my first "completed" project in Ableton. I've had a strong affinity in the last 
        several years for the noise and experimental scene, and have especially liked the contrast of 
        harsh noise against calmer vocals. I recorded a journal entry of mine and thought it would sound
        nice against that very backdrop. Added few simple chords to give it some more color (albeit a melancholy one).
        This is just a little draft, a creative exercise to put music into practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sound is strongly influenced by Lingua Ignota's 2021 EP <a href="https://linguaignota.bandcamp.com/album/agnus-dei" target="_blank">Agnus Dei</a>.
        Kristin Hayter always has a way of finding that perfect balance between serenity and madness, and I wanted to try my hand at expressing
        that in my own way.
