        This is a short track of a nice little acoustic plucking pattern that came to me after a jam session with some friends.
        Instead of lyrics, I thought humming would be a nice touch, in the style of Ichiko Aoba. The altogether sound,
        including the shower running in the background, is inspired by "Wet," the first track in Jockstrap's 2018 EP,

        The song is also part of a series of demos that I've been working on as a creative practice. It is the 84th song in the series.
